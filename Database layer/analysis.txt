PostgreSQL
*Pros
    1.Scalability
    2.Robustness
    3.Support for advanced features such as full-text search
    4.Handling large datasets and complex workloads
*Cons
    1.No horizontal scaling

Amazon Dynamo DB
*Pros
    1.Helps customers handle their high-traffic
    2.Extreme-scaled events seamlessly with nearly unlimited throughput
    3.Offers limitless scalability
    4.Performance is consistent at any scale
*Cons
    1.Weak querying model, querying data is extremely limited
    2.Lack of server-side scripts

    5.Provisioned throughput and batch jobs don't work well together

For me the best database is PostgreSQL.
The reason for this is because its open-source and supports the most advanced SQL features and standards.
